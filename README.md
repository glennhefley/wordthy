## Wordthy v 0.0.1

Worthy will contain a basic grammar checker, but the user would be wise to find a more focused tool if that area is a major concern. Likely it will have no more than functionality than the project Grammark [ https://grammark.org/dist/#/ ] offers.

The main focus of this project is toward the word types, the placement, sentence composition, and the valence, arousal and dominance value of the vocabulary of a composition. The goals for Wordthy to become a tool which brings out the desired impact of a  composition by offering the user multiple methods and insights into who to achieve their goal.

Wordthy is the manifestation of studies and experiments in the area of active and emotional connection patterns and glossaries. The main stage is the list of words which have been tested through multiple experiments and are now accepted as particularly strong in the areas of valence, arousal and dominance. Another area I hope to exploit is the latent semantic areas, especially focused on active language created through proper verb/noun patterns. The ability to predict which patterns are formed in brain scans when imagining a plant or an airplane, based on how these concepts as words co-occur in texts, suggests that it is possible to model mental representations based on word statistics. Whether counting how frequently nouns and verbs combine in Google search queries, or extracting eigenvectors from matrices made up of Wikipedia lines and Shakespeare plots, these latent semantics approximate the associative links that form concepts. However, cognition is fundamentally intertwined with action; even passively reading verbs has been shown to activate the same motor circuits as when we tap a ﬁnger or observe actual movements. My goal is to create these activities by intention.

Several studies over the the last 20 years have focused on comprehension and the glossaries which hinder or increase memory. For example, over a hundred independent studies have made it clear that profanity used inside a paragraph will increase accurate recall of all other facts in the passage by significant degrees. All the way back to the days of Aristotle it was well known that the bizarre, the strange and the unexpected improved recall when used inside the constructs known as Memory Palaces. 

We also know that particular words evoke both mental and physical changes to the reader. Take for example the word yawn. Yawn is short, and basic. Yawn is not a command, and thus benign. Yawn is even a common word. We hear the word yawn all the time. When someone yawns, however, other people yawn. There is a strange connection between yawning people, yawning. I’m sure there have been studies on yawning, and why when I yawn, you will yawn too. In fact, you don’t even need to see me yawn do you? No. You don’t. You just have to read the word yawn, a few times, and your mind will react just like the word yawn is a physical world  yawn, instead of just a word on the page. 

We do the same thing in the process of fantasizing during masturbation. There's no naked woman in the room.  But we are physically responding because our brain doesn't know that, and will respond to her all the way to climax. By exploiting vocabulary in these areas, tools for aggressive persuasion are forged and accessible to the writers.


Future goals for the project will attempt to offer usable tools which measure the current metaphors in a composition, and provide means and methods of improving and/or creating metaphors. This area will also provide methods and opportunities to utilized techniques such as Objective Correlatives. Objective correlatives are exercises in economy, but more importantly, they allow writers to communicate universal concepts tastefully and subtlety. This area will also delve into the use and measured effectiveness of symbolism and archetypes.

Lastly, Wordly will provide tools and methods for exploiting the Cognitive Bias List, which has strong persuasive holds on the majority of the population, thus offering a multi-level tools set of composing a message which carries the information and take-away points which satisfy the writer's goal, and provides medium, methods, and vocabulary connecting the reader to those desired points with strong persuasive measures and a higher probability of long term recall for the information carried by the message. 

With each of these areas, primary documentation, data and documentation will be provided so that the writer understands what each area has been studied for, and what usage will provide the greatest areas of success.
