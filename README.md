## Wordthy v 0.0.1

 
#### A friend of mine went to bed one evening, and woke up deaf.####
 
 <p>This malady is called [ Sudden Deafness Syndrome ](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/sudden-deafness). There’s no warning,  no indication ta profound change is coming with the dawn. No pain, illness, irritation, nothing. At 34, Susan couldn’t convey the smallest personal detail of her thoughts, her fear -- in  the space of less than eight hours she  had been cut off from all of us. And we were not the kind of folks to take that lying down. </p>
<p>She didn’t know sign language, and it wouldn’t have mattered much because if she could she would be the only one. She was 34 at the time and learning to program in JAVA. She didn't know about TTY/TRS, (the phone service for the deaf,) so she couldn't call and explain what was happening to her. She woke in terror, alone. It would be three months before skill sets were strong enough  to convey basic needs and resources without frustration and high emotions.  </p>
<p>Another three before she could convey the terror.</p>

<p>Can hearing loss happen suddenly?</p>
<p>*Sudden sensorineural hearing loss* (SSHL), also known as sudden deafness, occurs when you lose your hearing very quickly. It can happen instantly or over a span of several days. During this time, sound gradually becomes more muffled or faint. SSHL typically only affects one ear.Dec 2, 2015</p>

<B />All of our conversations were grueling, writing out by hand what _needed_ to be communicated -- using paragraphs to convey what voice inflection would add to a single sentence -- and her typing, and mine sucked. We coded, we didn't write novels _(I do now, but let's not get off track here)_ <B /><B />

Coding actually saved the day when we stumbled on the idea. Our hours willed away on Perl's 'one-liners' and poetry returned  us  nuance and a bit of inflection. It was impressive how well it fit itself to metaphor. It returned enough so that our small group could spend personal time with her rather than expending our resources into required information exchange.<B /><B />
 
*Telephone and Relay Services - National Association of the Deaf - NAD*<B />
[https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/telephone-and-relay-services/](https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/telephone-and-relay-services/)<B />[_Many older deaf and hard of hearing Americans remember relying on their families, friends, or neighbors to make a simple phone call._ <B /><B />
 
<B />[TTY is a service, which at it's base description, allows someone like my friend to call someone on the phone. The way it works is that my friend types out what she wishes to convey and the TTY operator reads this message to the other party. <B /><B />
 
This project will use Alexa and perhaps some of the other Ladies of the AI bot world, to offer this type of assistance, only in closer area and with ore ability. My main goal is for a project I'm calling  _Wordthy_. Research and skill upgrades for Wordthy suggested other projects could be accomplished as I reached certain levels of competence or able to utilize someone else’s competence. Wordthy is huge. Immense. I'll liking not see it's knowing and friendly interface for years. However _WordTTY_ is nearly done with some of the projects I’ve used as study time the last few weeks -- and well worth the effort. <B /><B />
 
Alexa's WordTTY is to be a bit more than TTY. Using NodeJS, combined with the Electron package, WordTTY will have macros, both keyed and code-key activated. (CTL-Alt-1*0=user phrases or activations of other programs), it's AI will 'listen' for key phrases which it can help with finding information for example, Mother, who doesn't do sign language either, asks Susan how she is going to be able to make phone calls.<B />
--- Susan writes down TRS. Mother asks,<B />
---  What is TRS?<B />
-- *?...! </sigh> <B /><B />
 
Being able to speak at this point would be nice because trying to explain about TTY service first, and then adding the operator, which forms the TRS service, is going to take Susan all night -- actually it won't. The reality is far worse. What will happen is her mother, like we all did in the beginning, will throw up her hands wave  Susan off, saying 'never mind'.... and we won't know or remember about it later. Susan will begin to feel like a burden, and that we don't care enough to learn about vital systems in her life --  and we'll have no idea that it's a vital system we should be intimate with. <B /><B />
 
I just asked my Alexa if she knew what the TRS service was, and she didn't but she will -- just as she will know many other ideas,  and terms as well as being armed with brief "at-a-glance" presentations for each of these concepts.<B /><B />
 
The first version of WordTTY will only be able to bring up the information and images for these at-a-glance info-graphics to the screen Susan is typing at. I am not sure how difficult it would be to get a web-server able to push codes to a Fire so that a client running on the Fire would respond by posting those to the screen, but it's on my list of things to find and master.<B /><B />
 
Soon, however, I would like WordTTY to be able to flash them to a Fire or Tablet of some other kind or use the connection to the TV Screens (which I have no idea how that is done but I will). <B /><B />
 
So the vision is fairly straightforward. Alexa, via the Echo (I think this would be a good recommendation because I've found this system to be fairly good at recognizing sentences accurately and from new voices... which I believe has it's success on the hardware more than anything else), will be between the visitors.<B /><B />
 
Alexa will hear for Susan, and send what she heard to Susan's screen -- which could be a Fire, or the laptop. Susan will reply using macros (there is a system of sorts in TTY ( https://goo.gl/NpKbga ) ,which will be HashTagged into WordTTY so #brb will prompt  Alexa to say: "Susan needs to do something, she's asking for you to wait for a moment", and #ca (the code to request the Communications Assistant to respond) will key Alexa for assistance: perhaps to look up information on a highlighted phrase or to ask her visitor to repeat what she said because Alexa didn't understand it well enough to convey. <B /><B />
 
This much done I'm going to call Version 1.001 and publish with the hopes of inciting others to help me make WordTTY as robust and usable as possible, both by helping with the main code which for now I believe will be on GitHub, and/or creating plug-ins, which is the part of this system I feel will take the most effort on my part to offer.  As I said, I'm a novelist now, and it's embarrassing how difficult it's been recalling how to code Javascript, let alone some of the other systems available.<B /><B />
 
Sign Language is a huge investment in time to become more than a gibbering idiot, and I never reached beyond gibbering. Fifteen years later, everything I did know is lost to me. So, WordTTY is going to be "out of the box" a blessing for anyone in who is challenged with deafness. Enhancing the system enough to be usable on a Fire (usable with strangers) would make the system portable. But a Dot and a Fire could do that as well.<B /><B />
 
But my main emotive is the memory of those first three months, and being unable to communicate enough to breach the fear, frustration, anger and sorrow to ask if she wanted a cup of coffee or would she prefer soup...<B /><B />
 
I plan on using every open-source project out there, which will bring me closer to a completed product, that I can find. I have seen some amazing projects and I'm going to put them to work. Been a long time since I've coded in a serious way (beyond rigging a one-liner poem as a  timer for my popcorn or something.)<B /><B />
 
I'll have a more formal project model up soon, just need to get started and on to the next, which is like this one, but more. <B /><B />
